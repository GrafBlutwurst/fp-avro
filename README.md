# fp-avro
This library provides access to generic Avro records and schemata in scala.

# Motivation
Working with Avro in a schema driven way in Scala has been quite a pain so far. Forcing you to directly interact with the org.apache.avro Java API. This meant some very heavy handed casting had to be done. 
The goal of fp-avro is to provide a principled and pure FP alternative to this using Recursion Schemes.
